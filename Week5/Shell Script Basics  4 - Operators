1) Read two numbers, Check if they are equal. Check if first argument is bigger than the second
2) Read two strings. Compare if they are equal. If equal. type strings are equal




1) Basic Operators

Operator	Description	Example
+ (Addition)	Adds values on either side of the operator	`expr $a + $b` will give 30
- (Subtraction)	Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand	`expr $a - $b` will give -10
* (Multiplication)	Multiplies values on either side of the operator	`expr $a \* $b` will give 200
/ (Division)	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand	`expr $b / $a` will give 2
% (Modulus)	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder	`expr $b % $a` will give 0
= (Assignment)	Assigns right operand in left operand	a = $b would assign value of b into a
== (Equality)	Compares two numbers, if both are same then returns true.	[ $a == $b ] would return false.
!= (Not Equality)	Compares two numbers, if both are different then returns true.	[ $a != $b ] would return true.

2) Relational Operators

Operator	Description	Example
-eq	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a -eq $b ] is not true.
-ne	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a -ne $b ] is true.
-gt	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a -gt $b ] is not true.
-lt	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a -lt $b ] is true.
-ge	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a -ge $b ] is not true.
-le	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a -le $b ] is true.


3) Boolean Operators 

Operator	Description	Example
!	This is logical negation. This inverts a true condition into false and vice versa.	[ ! false ] is true.
-o	This is logical OR. If one of the operands is true, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a -lt 20 -o $b -gt 100 ] is true.
-a	This is logical AND. If both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true otherwise false.	[ $a -lt 20 -a $b -gt 100 ] is false.

4) String Operators

Operator	Description	Example
=	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	[ $a = $b ] is not true.
!=	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if values are not equal then the condition becomes true.	[ $a != $b ] is true.
-z	Checks if the given string operand size is zero; if it is zero length, then it returns true.	[ -z $a ] is not true.
-n	Checks if the given string operand size is non-zero; if it is nonzero length, then it returns true.	[ -n $a ] is not false.
str	Checks if str is not the empty string; if it is empty, then it returns false.	[ $a ] is not false.
